== Features

* cluster support
* custom database configuration
* interactive setup tasks
* logging

Linux is required. Ubuntu and Gentoo are known to work.

Rv is designed for Camping, but it can actually manage any app for which you write a compatible Mongrel harness.

= Usage

== Installation

First, run:

  sudo gem install rv
  sudo rv install
  
This copies a very small script to <tt>/etc/init.d/rv</tt>. <b>Edit it and change the <tt>'user'</tt> keypair in the file if your app user is not <tt>httpd</tt>.</b> There are a few other options you can set; see the Rv class for details.

Now, install it as a boot service. On Ubuntu, run:
  sudo /usr/sbin/update-rc.d rv defaults

On Gentoo, run:
  sudo rc-update add rv default

== Application setup

Each Camping app should live in its own directory. Traverse to this directory and run:
  sudo rv setup

The app will now start at boot. You can start it manually (along with your other Rv apps) by running:
  sudo /etc/init.d/rv start

The script also responds to <tt>status</tt>, <tt>restart</tt>, and <tt>stop</tt>. You can adjust the app-specific configuration later by rerunning <tt>sudo rv setup</tt> or by editing <tt>/etc/rv/your_app.yml</tt>.

= Extras

== Troubleshooting

If you're having problems, first check <tt>/var/log/rv.log</tt>. If that doesn't help, run:
  sudo env RV_DEBUG=true /etc/init.d/rv start
  
Copy out the inner command (between the '<tt>nohup sudo -u httpd</tt>' and the '<tt>< /dev/null</tt>') and try running it by hand. Make sure you're using the correct user.

== Apache configuration

If you're using Apache 2.2, here's how to configure it to see your Camping proxy. Add a <tt>VirtualHost</tt> entry in your <tt>httpd.conf</tt> as follows:

  <VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName myapp.example.com
    
    ProxyRequests Off
    ProxyPass / http://127.0.0.1:4000/
    ProxyPassReverse / http://127.0.0.1:4000/
    ProxyPreserveHost On
    
    #Fix for Apache bug 39499
    SetEnv force-proxy-request-1.0 1
    SetEnv proxy-nokeepalive 1
  </VirtualHost>
  
If you configured a cluster, use a <tt>Proxy balancer</tt> instead:

  <VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName myapp.example.com

    <Proxy balancer://myapp_custer>
      BalancerMember http://127.0.0.1:4000
      BalancerMember http://127.0.0.1:4001
      BalancerMember http://127.0.0.1:4002
      # etc.
    </Proxy>

    ProxyPass / balancer://myapp_custer/
    ProxyPassReverse / balancer://myapp_custer/
    ProxyPreserveHost On

    #Fix for Apache bug 39499
    SetEnv force-proxy-request-1.0 1
    SetEnv proxy-nokeepalive 1  
  </VirtualHost>
  
Do not use the line <tt>ProxyRequests Off</tt>.
