DETAILED DOCUMENTATION

    http://blog.evanweaver.com/articles/2006/12/19/rv-a-tool-for-luxurious-camping

QUICKSTART

  Make a folder /etc/rv/. Also, copy etc/init.d/rv to the /etc/init.d/ folder. 
  Change the USER='httpd' near the top to the user the daemons should 
  run as (never root!).
  
  Install as a boot service (on Ubuntu) with:  
   
    $ sudo /usr/sbin/update-rc.d rv defaults
    
  If you are not using Ubuntu you may have to do something different. 
  Redhat uses chkconfig. Gentoo uses something else yet probably. On 
  OS X you can try to get launchd to work, if you are bold.

USAGE

  Copy the included harness/rv_harness.rb to your camping application's 
  folder. Edit it appropriately for your app and database. 
  
  Then, copy the example etc/rv/my_blog.yml file into /etc/rv. Rename 
  and edit it appropriately for your app. You need to set the path, proxy 
  port, and listen interface. For more apps, you can just add more .yml 
  files.
  
  Now you can manually start, stop or restart all your camping daemons 
  by calling:

    $ sudo /etc/init.d/rv start    
    $ sudo /etc/init.d/rv stop
    $ sudo /etc/init.d/rv restart

APACHE SETUP

  In most situations, you will also need an Apache vhost entry in httpd.conf 
  to reference the camping proxy started by rv. Here's one for Apache 2.2:

  <VirtualHost *:80>
      ServerName myblog.j2ee.com
    
      ProxyRequests Off
      ProxyPass / http://127.0.0.1:3055/
      ProxyPassReverse / http://127.0.0.1:3055/
      ProxyPreserveHost On
    
      #Fix for Apache bug 39499
      SetEnv force-proxy-request-1.0 1
      SetEnv proxy-nokeepalive 1
  </VirtualHost>
